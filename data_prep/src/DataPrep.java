 * 1. install MATLAB R2014b (other versions could work but will probably give you some issues)
 * 2. find your installation dir and change the paths in ReadMnist.java
 * 3. don't forget to add the .m files to your Matlab path (google it - it's easy)
 * 4. run this module and then tell me what's wrong, 'cause something totally will and I can't remember anything else to write here -_-
 * 5. rehearse all the foul constructs of your native language
